Welcome to the BACKUPS Folder
=============================

This folder contains everything that has been backed up. To recover your data perform the following:

1. Manually copy (=overwrite files) or sync (=overwrite folder content) the missing or corrupted data back to the computer (but DO NOT move the data).
2. Disconnect your backup disk and store it in the separate and secure location again.
