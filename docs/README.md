Essential Backup Documents

*"Important data have backups, all the rest is unimportant."*

This saying highlights the importance of data backups. So now is the time to create a backup plan and to perform backups repeatedly.

Tips for Creating a Successful Data Backup Plan
-----------------------------------------------
Here are some tips for creating a successful data backup or disaster recovery plan:

* **Identify what data needs to be backed up.** Not all data is equally important, so it's important to prioritize which data needs to be backed up first. Make a list of your company's most critical data and make sure that this data is included in your backup plan.
* **Choose the right backup method.** There are many ways to back up data, so choosing the method best suits your needs are important. If you have large amounts of data to backup, you may want to consider using an online backup service.
* **Store backups in a safe location.** Once you have made your backups, storing them in a safe and secure location is crucial. If you are using an external hard drive, make sure that it is stored in a fire-proof and water-proof safe.
* **Test your backups regularly.** It's important to test your backups regularly to ensure that they are working properly. Restore your backups to a test environment and check that all of your data can be accessed as expected.
* **Keep your backup plan up to date.** As your business grows and changes, so too should your backup plan. Review your backup plan regularly and ensure it is still meeting your needs.

Types of data backups 
---------------------
When deciding on a backup data storage strategy, there are different types of data backups you can perform to help protect your personal data. Depending on the size of the data you’d like to protect and the frequency with which you’d like to back it up, you can decide between these three data backup options:         

* **Full backups:** This method backs up every single file on your device. Because of this, the process could take many hours depending on the size of the data. A full backup is recommended when you’re backing up your data for the first time. 

* **Differential backups:** With a differential backup, you’re only backing up files that have changed or have been added since your last full backup. Because of this, differential backups can be performed much more quickly than a full backup. 

* **Incremental backups:** Like a differential backup, incremental backups also only back up data that has been changed or added since the last backup. The difference is that incremental backups will back up any changed data since the last backup, whether it was a full, differential, or incremental backup. These types of backups are often performed by backup software because they can be done frequently due to their small size and fast backup time.
