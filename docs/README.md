Essential Backup Documents
==========================

*"Important data have backups, all the rest is unimportant."*

This saying highlights the importance of data backups. So now is the time to create a backup plan and to perform backups repeatedly.

Why You Should Back Up Your Data
--------------------------------
* **Backups protect you from data loss -** If your computer crashes or your hard drive fails, you could lose all of your data. Backing up your data protects you from this type of data loss and allows you to restore previous versions of your files.
* **Backups guard you against malware and ransomware -** If your computer becomes infected with malware or ransomware, your data could be encrypted and made inaccessible. Backing up your data protects you from this type of data loss.
* **Recover from data loss more quickly -** If you lose data, it can take a long time to recover. If you have a backup, you can quickly restore your data and get back to work.
Data Gives You Peace of Mind - Knowing that your data is backed up can give you peace of mind. If something happens to your data, you know you have a backup and can rest assured that you can recover it.
* **Remote access -** If you have a backup of your data, you can access it from anywhere in the world. This is extremely useful if you work remotely or travel frequently. All you need is an internet connection, and you can get to your files.


What data should I back up? 
---------------------------
As a baseline, you should back up anything that can’t be replaced if it’s lost.  For individuals, this might include:

* Address books
* Pictures
* Videos
* Music files
* Emails
* Documents
* Spreadsheets
* Financial databases 

For businesses, data backup options become a bit more technical — think of backing up customer databases, configuration files, machine images, operating systems, and registry files — and there’s typically an IT department in place to manage them.

Types of data backups 
---------------------
When deciding on a backup data storage strategy, there are different types
of data backups you can perform to help protect your personal data.
Depending on the size of the data you’d like to protect and the frequency
with which you’d like to back it up, you can decide between these three data backup options:         

* **Full backups:** This method backs up every single file on your device. Because of this, the process could take many hours depending on the size of the data. A full backup is recommended when you’re backing up your data for the first time. 

* **Differential backups:** With a differential backup, you’re only backing up files that have changed or have been added since your last full backup. Because of this, differential backups can be performed much more quickly than a full backup. 

* **Incremental backups:** Like a differential backup, incremental backups also only back up data that has been changed or added since the last backup. The difference is that incremental backups will back up any changed data since the last backup, whether it was a full, differential, or incremental backup. These types of backups are often performed by backup software because they can be done frequently due to their small size and fast backup time.
