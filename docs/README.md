
Types of data backups 
---------------------
When deciding on a backup data storage strategy, there are different types
of data backups you can perform to help protect your personal data.
Depending on the size of the data you’d like to protect and the frequency
with which you’d like to back it up, you can decide between these three data backup options:         

* **Full backups:** This method backs up every single file on your device. Because of this, the process could take many hours depending on the size of the data. A full backup is recommended when you’re backing up your data for the first time. 

* **Differential backups:** With a differential backup, you’re only backing up files that have changed or have been added since your last full backup. Because of this, differential backups can be performed much more quickly than a full backup. 

* **Incremental backups:** Like a differential backup, incremental backups also only back up data that has been changed or added since the last backup. The difference is that incremental backups will back up any changed data since the last backup, whether it was a full, differential, or incremental backup. These types of backups are often performed by backup software because they can be done frequently due to their small size and fast backup time. 


What data should I back up? 
---------------------------
As a baseline, you should back up anything that can’t be replaced if it’s lost.  For individuals, this might include:

* Address books
* Pictures
* Videos
* Music files
* Emails
* Documents
* Spreadsheets
* Financial databases 

For businesses, data backup options become a bit more technical — think of backing up customer databases, configuration files, machine images, operating systems, and registry files — and there’s typically an IT department in place to manage them.
