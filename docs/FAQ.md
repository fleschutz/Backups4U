Backup FAQ's
============

Why back up at all?
-------------------
* **Backups protect you from data loss -** If your computer crashes or your hard drive fails, you could lose all of your data. Backing up your data protects you from this type of data loss and allows you to restore previous versions of your files.
* **Backups guard you against malware and ransomware -** If your computer becomes infected with malware or ransomware, your data could be encrypted and made inaccessible. Backing up your data protects you from this type of data loss.
* **Recover from data loss more quickly -** If you lose data, it can take a long time to recover. If you have a backup, you can quickly restore your data and get back to work.
Data Gives You Peace of Mind - Knowing that your data is backed up can give you peace of mind. If something happens to your data, you know you have a backup and can rest assured that you can recover it.
* **Remote access -** If you have a backup of your data, you can access it from anywhere in the world. This is extremely useful if you work remotely or travel frequently. All you need is an internet connection, and you can get to your files.

What data should I back up? 
---------------------------
As a baseline, you should back up anything that can’t be replaced if it’s lost.  For individuals, this might include:

* Address books
* Pictures
* Videos
* Music files
* Emails
* Documents
* Spreadsheets
* Financial databases 

For businesses, data backup options become a bit more technical — think of backing up customer databases, configuration files, machine images, operating systems, and registry files — and there’s typically an IT department in place to manage them.

What is XYZ?
------------
See the [Glossary](Glossary.md), please.

Can I start the backup scripts in parallel?
-------------------------------------------
Yes, but it might not be faster (due to bottlenecks such as same source media or same backup disk).

What's the problem with cloud backups?
--------------------------------------
In a real disaster the internet is the first thing that doesn't work and afterward it's the last thing that will be up and running. In the meantime (which may last days/weeks/months) your backup is out of reach.

Is it OK to copy other data onto a backup disk?
-----------------------------------------------
Sure, as long as there is enough disk space left.
