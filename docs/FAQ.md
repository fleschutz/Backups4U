# FAQ

**What is XYZ?** See the [Glossary](Glossary.md), please.

**Can I start the backup scripts in parallel?** Yes, but it might not be faster (due to bottlenecks such as same source media or same backup disk).

**What's the problem with cloud backups?** In a real disaster/catastrophe/etc. the internet (and your backup) is the first that doesn't work and afterward the last thing that will be rebuild.

**Is it OK to copy other data onto a backup disk?** Sure, as long as there is enough disk space left.
